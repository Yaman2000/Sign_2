        <h2>WHAT IS SIGN LANGUAGE</h2>
        <div class="hero-content">
        <p>Indian Sign language offers a huge collection of (ISL) signs. Each sign has an image, running video and threaded discussions.
             It is an ideal resource to use while you learn/teach Indian Sign Language.  Each sign has an image, running video and threaded discussions.
              <br> We are continually adding more signs and designing new services to empower the Deaf.
            Please share your ideas and comments and help us make this service better.Indian Sign Language (ISL) is used in the deaf community all over India. But ISL is not used in
            deaf schools to teach deaf children. Teacher training programs do not orient teachers towards teaching
            methods that use ISL. <br>There is no teaching material that incorporates sign language. Parents of deaf
            children are not aware about sign language and its ability to remove communication barriers. ISL
            interpreters are an urgent requirement at institutes and places where communication between deaf and
            hearing people takes place but India has only less than 300 certified interpreters.
            Therefore, an institute that met all these needs was a necessity. <br>After a long struggle by the deaf
            community, the Ministry approved the establishment of ISLRTC at New Delhi on 28th September, 2015.
            To build an inclusive society in which equal opportunities are provided for the growth
            and development of Persons with Disabilities so that they can lead productive, safe and dignified lives.<br>
            To empower Persons with Disabilities, through its various Acts/Institutions/Organizations and Schemes
            for rehabilitation and to create an enabling environment that provides such persons with equal
            opportunities, protection of their rights and enables them to participate as independent and productive
            members of society.</p>
